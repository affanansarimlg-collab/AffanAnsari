## 📝 Professional Description

I am an **Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate** with a strong interest in **embedded systems, hardware design, and intelligent electronic applications**. I have hands-on experience in **PCB assembly, component testing, microcontroller-based systems, and hardware debugging** through an industry internship.

My primary focus is on **embedded systems, IoT, and hardware–software integration** using **Embedded C/C++, Arduino, ESP32, and Verilog HDL**.  
Alongside this, I have **recently started learning Machine Learning at a beginner level**, where I am exploring **Python, data preprocessing, and basic supervised learning models** to understand how AI can complement embedded and IoT systems.

I am currently building my foundation in ML through **small projects, coursework, and experimentation**, with the long-term goal of integrating **AI techniques into embedded and real-time systems**.

🎯 **Career Goal:** To grow as an **Embedded Systems Engineer** while gradually developing skills in **Machine Learning and AI-assisted embedded applications**.
